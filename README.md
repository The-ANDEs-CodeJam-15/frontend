## Guess The Song (But Cursed)

Guess The Song (But Cursed) is a multiplayer web game that allows users to compete with friends to see who has the best music knowledge. The twist: players who do well will have the opportunity to “curse” opponents. A curse applies some audio effect to the song to make it harder to discern, ranging from distortion to “chopping” the audio. Players increase their score by guessing the answer as fast as possible, and gain the ability to curse others by being the first to guess correctly in a given round.


## Development

The frontend was built using NextJS and React, using Tailwind for styling. This project was made for the 15th iteration of CodeJam, a hackathon affiliated with McGill.
